Timeline API:


Todo:
- links
  - done in annoying popups, but:
  - need to have internal links as links
     - can put <a>'s in title, works OK, but then shows up escaped in Bubble!  Fuck!
     - and they stopped working!  God damn, worked last night, now not, nothing has changed!  Er, the styling? (NO)
        Oh, it actually works (in CHrome at least) but also puts up the bubble.
  - need to set _target (DONE?)
- icons
  - done, but formatting needs adjusting (see       /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/compact-painter.js
  - some appear huge!  Argh, I guess this is a known twitter problem
- Webpage for user/password
- Use OAuth
- dynamic update on scroll
- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to first cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different
- unames, @foo, #foo could all be links as well.
- timezone

Deployment:
- EC2 (expensive)
- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service. (Heroku)
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
  - and there's an OAuth plugin, of course
- or PHP even, and it can run on hyperphor
- Need to get local version of simile to guart against breakage.

Message to twivatar author (but I think the problem may be at twitter)
  http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=396

Thanks for building Twivatar and making it available as a public resource!  

However, I'm writing to report a bug, which is that some mini icons are not in fact very miniaturized.  For instance, this URL:

   http://twivatar.org/danbri/mini

Redirects to this one, which is fairly large:

   http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/502641047/danbri-4x-buttons-foaf_mini.jpg

It looks like the string "mini" in the original image name is confusing things somehow -- all the cases where this is happening look like that.

Anyway, thanks again, let me know if I can help.
