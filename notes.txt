Timeline API:


Todo:
- needs some kind of link back to regular twitter site (on unames?)
  - would be cool to do it in a frame on the same page!

- easy to get lost, need a way to get back to current time.

- bubble is useless and text has html guff in it.  Maybe just get rid of it?

- dates aren't shown anywhere

- links
  - done in annoying popups, but:
  - need to have internal links as links
     - can put <a>'s in title, works OK, but then shows up escaped in Bubble!  Fuck!
     - and they stopped working!  God damn, worked last night, now not, nothing has changed! 
         (FIXED with a patch, yay me)
  - need to set _target (DONE?)
- icons
  - done, but formatting needs adjusting (see       /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/compact-painter.js
  - some appear huge!  Argh, I guess this is a known twitter problem

- Webpage for user/password
- Use OAuth

- dynamic update on scroll

- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to second cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different

- unames, @foo, #foo could all be links as well.

- timezone

- what's with 127.0.0.1 - - [Mon, 28 Dec 2009 18:17:10 GMT] "GET /__history__.html?0 HTTP/1.1" 404 -1

Deployment:
- EC2 (expensive)
- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service. (Heroku)
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
  - and there's an OAuth plugin, of course
 - or PHP even, and it can run on hyperphor
 - or do everything in Javascript with no server involvement...
     - hm, bad-timeline.js does this by using the &callback option to the search API, which returns an executable piece of javascript that gets put into a script element.  This options does not exist for the home_timeline, for some reason.  NO, it does exist, just not documented!

- Need to get local version of simile to guart against breakage.

Message to twivatar author (but I think the problem may be at twitter)
  http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=396

Thanks for building Twivatar and making it available as a public resource!  

However, I'm writing to report a bug, which is that some mini icons are not in fact very miniaturized.  For instance, this URL:

   http://twivatar.org/danbri/mini

Redirects to this one, which is fairly large:

   http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/502641047/danbri-4x-buttons-foaf_mini.jpg

It looks like the string "mini" in the original image name is confusing things somehow -- all the cases where this is happening look like that.

Anyway, thanks again, let me know if I can help.

DONE depo
