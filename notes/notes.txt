Twitter API:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-friends_timeline

Timeline API:
  http://simile-widgets.org/wiki/Timeline

Todo:

- Login/search/etc flow
   Logout: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-account%C2%A0end_session

- #foo in search doesn't work (url encoding I think)

- (minor) Enter in search box

- dates aren't shown anywhere

- would like to change layout so later things appear under rather than over.

- layout -- if there are too many things in one time slice, you lose.  That's kind of sucky.

- maybe images should not come from twivatr

- twitter queries should have user-agent string  
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting

- should do better url extraction, ie: 
   People are upset that I criticized some atheists (http://is.gd/5Kgj8). We should be the ones to welcome constructive criticism.
Note that twitter itself fucks this one up

- local search 
  Here's how you do it...would need a gmap or something for specifying it.
  url = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?&rpp=100&geocode=37.638015%2C-122.494812%2C10km"

- dynamic update on scroll

- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to second cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different
   - need to indicate mode

- unames (DONE), @foo(DONE), #foo could all be links as well.
  #foo should do a search in the timeline

- timezone

- what's with 127.0.0.1 - - [Mon, 28 Dec 2009 18:17:10 GMT] "GET /__history__.html?0 HTTP/1.1" 404 -1

Deployment:
- Lisp on EC2 (expensive and highly unncessary)
  http://tech.coop/Hosting%20Services SBCL hosting $10/month!  GOod for future ref

- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service. (Heroku)
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
  - and there's an OAuth plugin, of course

- or PHP even, and it can run on hyperphor

- or do everything in Javascript with no server involvement...
    Unfortunately this can't work (could with a simple PHP proxy, but lose the no-server advantages)

- Need to get local version of simile to guart against breakage.

Message to twivatar author (but I think the problem may be at twitter)
  http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=396

Thanks for building Twivatar and making it available as a public resource!  

However, I'm writing to report a bug, which is that some mini icons are not in fact very miniaturized.  For instance, this URL:

   http://twivatar.org/danbri/mini

Redirects to this one, which is fairly large:

   http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/502641047/danbri-4x-buttons-foaf_mini.jpg

It looks like the string "mini" in the original image name is confusing things somehow -- all the cases where this is happening look like that.

Anyway, thanks again, let me know if I can help.
