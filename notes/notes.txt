Twitter API:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-friends_timeline

Timeline API:
  http://simile-widgets.org/wiki/Timeline

Dynlite theory:
- server keeps track of max and min id it has sent out
- client can request more on the high end or low end -- doesn't need to pass any args
- server serializes requests, if one is already going it just sends back empty

I think that will do it...wont' support scrolling to arb. date, but that's life.
   YAY, I did this and it worked first time out of the box!  I am hot shit!


Todo:

- hm, and I guess clicking on names should take you to the timeline view by default.  And there should be a link somewhere for normal twitter view

- indicator of mode and link to corresponding standard twitter page.

- default screen should not be public timeline, which is useless...I could show a search

- stack in other direction
   Hard to see where this works...I think here:
     /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/original-painter.js
  tracks seem to be the rows within a band...
   reversing event sources doesn't help, not too surprising.

- some bugs seem to have crept into incremental update
  - easy to get multiple entries.  Serialize at server or client?
    DONE at client, still not perfect 

---------------------------------above here for release---------------------------------------

- would be neat if timeline scale was adaptive.

- some option to limit searches to english

- break/url matching still losing occationally:  Problem is # in url, which the hairy URL matched can't deal with
    http://twitter.com/edyson/status/7576944417
    edyson: the Edge Question Center, including mine on information metabolic syndrome: http://www.edge.org/q2010/q10_2.html#dysone

- local search 
  Here's how you do it...would need a gmap or something for specifying it.
  url = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?&rpp=100&geocode=37.638015%2C-122.494812%2C10km"

- lower band should have different look.  Not sure how to do that.
   or just elimate it...

- minor: NOW scrolls Now to center, which wastes half the screen...but actually given that the blips are large, it's not that bad.  Worse on giant screens

- IDEA: follow links, if they are images put them in the timeline..

- holy shit seems like this could be useful:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation#statuses/firehose
   curl -u mtraven http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json

- want way to go to specific time (reload has to work)
   impossible with new simpler scrolling scheme, unfortunately.

- would be nice to AND search, and have persistent searches, and sort of automatically cons you a timeline based on them.

- ought to expand vertically for big screenss
  (done, but needs to be smarter)


- (minor) embedded LFs in tweets break formatting?

- wild-ass idea: include feedback, scale blocks depending on how much we like this person/term.  Could make it practical to have busy streams.  

- idea: do same for Friendfeed!
  http://friendfeed.com/api/documentation#read_feed
  uses Oauth and Json, should be easy.

- idea: use this api to get identity of user (and key state to it)
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-user_timeline

- would be nice to visually indicate the last-clicked block, so when you go back to that window you can find it.

- would like to change layout so later things appear under rather than over.

- layout -- if there are too many things in one time slice, you lose.  That's kind of sucky.

- redo colors, roundrects. 

- maybe images should not come from twivatr

- I'm doing this all wrong:
   http://docs.heroku.com/background-jobs

- Flow: Login/search/etc 
   Login is unnecessary
   Logout: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-account%C2%A0end_session
   need to indicate mode (public, home, search, etc)

- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to second cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different



- timezone

- what's with 127.0.0.1 - - [Mon, 28 Dec 2009 18:17:10 GMT] "GET /__history__.html?0 HTTP/1.1" 404 -1
     OK, has to do with some history mechanism, but I'm not sure what. 
     /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/ajax/api/scripts/history.js


Deployment:
- Lisp on EC2 (expensive and highly unncessary)
  http://tech.coop/Hosting%20Services SBCL hosting $10/month!  GOod for future ref

- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service. (Heroku)
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
  - and there's an OAuth plugin, of course

- or PHP even, and it can run on hyperphor

- or do everything in Javascript with no server involvement...
    Unfortunately this can't work (could with a simple PHP proxy, but lose the no-server advantages)

- Need to get local version of simile to guart against breakage.


-----
Message to twivatar author (but I think the problem may be at twitter)
  http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=396

Thanks for building Twivatar and making it available as a public resource!  

However, I'm writing to report a bug, which is that some mini icons are not in fact very miniaturized.  For instance, this URL:

   http://twivatar.org/danbri/mini

Redirects to this one, which is fairly large:

   http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/502641047/danbri-4x-buttons-foaf_mini.jpg

It looks like the string "mini" in the original image name is confusing things somehow -- all the cases where this is happening look like that.

Anyway, thanks again, let me know if I can help.

Mike Travers

DONE depo
- I wonder if I could get tweets folded into two lines, would match icons and generally  (DONE)
- needs some kind of link back to regular twitter site (on unames?)
- easy to get lost, need a way to get back to current time. (DONE)
- links
  - done in annoying popups, but:
  - need to have internal links as links
     - can put <a>'s in title, works OK, but then shows up escaped in Bubble!  Fuck!
     - and they stopped working!  God damn, worked last night, now not, nothing has changed! 
         (FIXED with a patch, yay me)
  - need to set _target (DONE?)
- bubble is useless and text has html guff in it.  Maybe just get rid of it?
    DONE
- oh fuck, oauth is not actually working

- Use standard rather than debug (DONE, with flag that I need to test)
- credits (DONE)
- fix urls to be more neat, and get landing page right (DONE)

- host name (Did DNS setup, waiting)

- search is broken at server (FIXED by changing URL)

- icons
  - done, but formatting needs adjusting (see         /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/compact-painter.js
  - some appear huge!  Argh, I guess this is a known twitter problem
  (FIXED)

- Use OAuth (DONE)

- Webpage for user/password (not necessary with OAuth)

- dates aren't shown anywhere (FIXED, shows days now)

- #foo in search doesn't work (url encoding I think) (FXIED)

- unames (DONE), @foo(DONE), #foo could all be links as well. (DONE)
  #foo should do a search in the timeline (DONE)

- search needs to work with new incremental mechanisms (DONE)
   twitter search takes since_id, not max_id...sigh.

- console.log only works when Firebug is open!  So make sure it isn't in deployed version (DONE)

- auto-scroll, ambience.
  RESOLVED: just do auto-scroll forward, forget going into past, solves all the time crap.
  or experiment with since parameter.
  
- dynamic update on scroll
  sort of working (in branch) but completely breaks search
  - it ought to be driven by lower band I guess.
  - Re "nowing" doesn't update, I think theres a bug in the range related to current-time (whcih can change)

- twitter queries should have user-agent string  
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting

- (minor) line break should be smarter, go backwards if necessary. (DONE)

- (minor) Enter in search box (DONE)

- hashtags work!  But need to update search box. (DONE)
