In progress:

- Background stuff works on Heroku, BUT the end message dies.
=> "uncaught throw `Error from Twitter: Forbidden url was: http://twitter.com/direct_messages/new.json?text=Your+blogs+have+been+processed+at+http%3A%2F%2Ftwitlines.net%2Fblogs&user=mtraven'
/disk1/home/slugs/108099_3d96461_4b8c/mnt/app/controllers/application_controller.rb:63

- bug: if follow/unfollow gets an error, it's ugly.  Need a catch.
  (ie, jhabermas today:
  This account is currently suspended and is being investigated due to strange activity.; request: /friendships/create.json?screen_name=jhabermas'):

- delayed_jobs
  - to debug
      j = Job.find(1)
      j.payload_object.perform

     Delayed::Job.enqueue(u)

   OK, started code to fuck with heroku in lib/cheap_ass.rb
    - but how to turn off?  There's no way! God damn it.  An hourly cron job would do it, costs $3/month
    - how about enqueing another job that checks for shutting off? (NO, how about FAILING)



- BUG with last one of my blogs (Scalzi)
- did redirect if no blogs known (NOT YET TESTED)

- needs explanatory text somewhere.
- link from twitlines?
- /blogs should be home.  Should redirect if not authorized.

- dm (untested) (needs an account and way to authenticate -- OAuth is probably not appropriate?)
 - got twit__lines (2 underscores) with normal Twitter pwd
 - needs to be called from User.
 - argh, have to follow first! (I think there is some way to get whitelisted, but its hard)

- getting current user and storing stuff

  application_controller#current_user is wrong -- ought save tname when authentication is done, fergawdssake

- Started, not working: delayed_jobs. 

- On the signup page, it would be useful to see last tweet and frequency...and/or links to main twitter page.  Prob hard to do that.

IDEA: you should be able to MAKE a twitter feed for a blog if it doesn't have one.  
 - some ethical issues?
 - isn't there an RSS to Twitter facilty already? Don't I use it?
    http://twitterfeed.com/

Todo:
- eliminate dups when parsing XML (case-foldingly, see regretsy)
  - harder: deal with dups in list page
- timestamp parse and do it in background every night
- parser should ignore http://twitter.com/jacobrothstein/status/6322934815 type URLs 

- home page:  "You submitted your OPML on 1/1/1 and had nnn blogs".  Reupload.  

- follow All button!  Oy vey.

How to do this as a web app?

- user upload OPML
- immediately creates blog objects
- makes COMET connections?
  http://juggernaut.rubyforge.org/ (er, no, way too much)

Dones:
- FUCK, application is read-only. My attempts to set it to read/write aren't taking.
   (FIXED, needed to revoke access)
- need to authenticate requests.  Seems like we pass authenticity_token by default
   (I think this is working magically)

- partials for follwing/etc (DONE)
Get friends (followees) -- needs to be paged, bleah  (DONE)
