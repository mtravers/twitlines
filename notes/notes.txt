Twitter API:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-friends_timeline

Timeline API:
  http://simile-widgets.org/wiki/Timeline

Dynlite theory:
- server keeps track of max and min id it has sent out
- client can request more on the high end or low end -- doesn't need to pass any args
- server serializes requests, if one is already going it just sends back empty

I think that will do it...wont' support scrolling to arb. date, but that's life.

In progress:
- ok, we got a decorator to work. Now need to figure out how to scroll adequately.


Todo:

* if you do a search for a sparse term, you get a blank screen. Yuck.  Should autoscroll to latest tweet at least.  Or better, compress.

- Image at OAUth page no longer matches app!
- why is our favicon the twitter icon? weird.

- way to mark tweets (favorite, etc) would be nice...too much stuff going by, too distrating to open a window for each.

DUH: have permalinks for various search options, so the thing can be linked to! 
  - WORKS except old URL gets left around, kind ugly...
  - also, if you give iterm param and are logged in, you get item in search but home timeline
  - current routes are very confusing -- put data feeds under /data

Argh, twisty:
 - page onload gets data from /twitlines/default, which looks at user[:session]
 - if you wanted to pass a URL param, that's kind of heinous...hm...

Regexp and link generation

-  bare hostnames get tagged as URLS (regexp matched) but they fail when clicked because they go to http://twitlines.com/www.foobar.com

- this one gets screwy too, OK on twitter:
  http://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/7687185693
 Google retaliates for attacks traced back to China, saying it will no longer filter search results there. Morehttp://www.cnn.com/

- break/url matching still losing occationally:  Problem is # in url, which the hairy URL matched can't deal with

    edyson: the Edge Question Center, including mine on information metabolic syndrome: http://www.edge.org/q2010/q10_2.html#dysone

- (minor) embedded LFs in tweets break formatting?

Scrolling and inc updates

*** now should not be at center, wastes half the screen in realtime mode.
    Worse on giant screens.
    Needs some graphic indication (DONE)
     - graphic indication should always update, although not necessarily scroll.




- now often doesn't fill in new stuff
   maybe need to change incremental theory yet again..."later" should always try to get up to the minute if possible, and iterate if not.

- some bugs seem to have crept into incremental update
  - easy to get multiple entries.  Serialize at server or client?
    DONE at client, still not perfect 
     Seen some really horrible cases where things get loaded repeatedl.
       OK, trigger on upper band, not lower.  Still some dups, may be off-by-ones in the query

Modes

- hm, and I guess clicking on names should take you to the timeline view by default.  And there should be a link somewhere for normal twitter view
- indicator of mode and link to corresponding standard twitter page.
   Partly done.  

- default screen should not be public timeline, which is useless...I could show a search
   DONE, sort of, with iterm parameter

** local search 
  Here's how you do it...would need a gmap or something for specifying it.
  url = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?&rpp=100&geocode=37.638015%2C-122.494812%2C10km"

- nice to be able to follow lists like http://twitter.com/BreakingNews/haiti-quake

Layout

- stack in other direction
   Hard to see where this works...I think here:
     /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/original-painter.js
    -- see variable trackIncrement -- but prob. negative won't work
  tracks seem to be the rows within a band...
   reversing event sources doesn't help, not too surprising.  (YAY, THIS WORKS NOW)
   -hm, the close-packing gets stuff out of obvious order....can think of some ways to tweak that.


- ought to expand vertically for big screenss
  (done, but needs to be smarter)

Wild-ass ideas

- wild-ass idea: include feedback, scale blocks depending on how much we like this person/term.  Could make it practical to have busy streams.  

- would be neat if timeline scale was adaptive.
   there are zoom commands so changing scales dynamically is not tha thard

- IDEA: follow links, if they are images put them in the timeline..

- Random thought: Each twitter followee should be ranked, and the timeline show the highest-most ranked that can fit.
   This is actually EASY to do...


Misc

*  need to catch twitter errors and do something other than an alert box...
   DONE -- but would be even better if we could transmit an error message back...

- would be nice to visually indicate the last-clicked block, so when you go back to that window you can find it.  ---  and/or highlight recent additions somehow

- some option to limit searches to english

- lower band should have different look.  Not sure how to do that.
   or just eliminate it...

- want way to go to specific time (reload has to work)
   impossible with new simpler scrolling scheme, unfortunately.

- would be nice to AND search, and have persistent searches, and sort of automatically cons you a timeline based on them.

- idea: use this api to get identity of user (and key state to it)
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-user_timeline
   (tried this but could not get it working...)

Plumbing

- holy shit seems like this could be useful:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation#statuses/firehose
   curl -u mtraven http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json

- I'm doing this all wrong:
   http://docs.heroku.com/background-jobs

- what's with 127.0.0.1 - - [Mon, 28 Dec 2009 18:17:10 GMT] "GET /__history__.html?0 HTTP/1.1" 404 -1
     OK, has to do with some history mechanism, but I'm not sure what. 
     /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/ajax/api/scripts/history.js

- Need to get local version of simile to guard against breakage.
  and allow development on the subway..

- some cases where whoami dies on login, but couldn't repeat it.

----------

- idea: do same for Friendfeed!
  http://friendfeed.com/api/documentation#read_feed
  uses Oauth and Json, should be easy.

- layout -- if there are too many things in one time slice, you lose.  That's kind of sucky.

- Flow: Login/search/etc 
   Login is unnecessary
   Logout: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-account%C2%A0end_session
   need to indicate mode (public, home, search, etc)

- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to second cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different

- timezone


DONE depo

- I wonder if I could get tweets folded into two lines, would match icons and generally  (DONE)
- needs some kind of link back to regular twitter site (on unames?)
- easy to get lost, need a way to get back to current time. (DONE)
- links
  - done in annoying popups, but:
  - need to have internal links as links
     - can put <a>'s in title, works OK, but then shows up escaped in Bubble!  Fuck!
     - and they stopped working!  God damn, worked last night, now not, nothing has changed! 
         (FIXED with a patch, yay me)
  - need to set _target (DONE?)
- bubble is useless and text has html guff in it.  Maybe just get rid of it?
    DONE
- oh fuck, oauth is not actually working

- Use standard rather than debug (DONE, with flag that I need to test)
- credits (DONE)
- fix urls to be more neat, and get landing page right (DONE)

- host name (Did DNS setup, waiting)

- search is broken at server (FIXED by changing URL)

- icons
  - done, but formatting needs adjusting (see         /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/compact-painter.js
  - some appear huge!  Argh, I guess this is a known twitter problem
  (FIXED)

- Use OAuth (DONE)

- Webpage for user/password (not necessary with OAuth)

- dates aren't shown anywhere (FIXED, shows days now)

- #foo in search doesn't work (url encoding I think) (FXIED)

- unames (DONE), @foo(DONE), #foo could all be links as well. (DONE)
  #foo should do a search in the timeline (DONE)

- search needs to work with new incremental mechanisms (DONE)
   twitter search takes since_id, not max_id...sigh.

- console.log only works when Firebug is open!  So make sure it isn't in deployed version (DONE)
  
- dynamic update on scroll
  sort of working (in branch) but completely breaks search
  - it ought to be driven by lower band I guess.
  - Re "nowing" doesn't update, I think theres a bug in the range related to current-time (whcih can change)

- twitter queries should have user-agent string  
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting

- (minor) line break should be smarter, go backwards if necessary. (DONE)

- (minor) Enter in search box (DONE)

- hashtags work!  But need to update search box. (DONE)

- visited color is too ugly, make it subtler (FIXED)


- DEBUG flag doesn't work -- js errors
   Argh, it's an incompatibility with prototype. FUCK  FIXED



- have a follow @mtraven link somewheres (DONE)

- auto-scroll, ambience.  (DONE, to first order)
   - needs to be controlled...idea that now should be locking?   
      - if you scroll by hand it has to leave that mode... (DONE -- need a toggling button)
   - period of 15 sec gets service timeouts
    STARTED putting in a locking button and logic to deal with it, not working yet
     needs to untoggle when clicked in down state, duh
