Todo:
- need to authenticate.  Seems like we pass authenticity_token by default
- eliminate dups when parsing XML (case-foldingly, see regretsy)
  - harder: deal with dups in list page
- partials for follwing/etc
- timestamp parse and do it in background every night

- home page:  "You submitted your OPML on 1/1/1 and had nnn blogs".  Reupload.  

- follow All button!  Oy vey.

How to do this as a web app?

- user upload OPML
- immediately creates blog objects
- makes COMET connections?
