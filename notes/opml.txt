In progress:
- dm (untested) (needs an account and way to authenticate -- OAuth is probably not appropriate?)
 - needs to be called from User.

- getting current user and storing stuff

  application_controller#current_user is wrong -- ought save tname when authentication is done, fergawdssake

- Started, not working: delayed_jobs. 



Todo:
- eliminate dups when parsing XML (case-foldingly, see regretsy)
  - harder: deal with dups in list page
- timestamp parse and do it in background every night
- parser should ignore http://twitter.com/jacobrothstein/status/6322934815 type URLs 

- home page:  "You submitted your OPML on 1/1/1 and had nnn blogs".  Reupload.  

- follow All button!  Oy vey.

How to do this as a web app?

- user upload OPML
- immediately creates blog objects
- makes COMET connections?
  http://juggernaut.rubyforge.org/ (er, no, way too much)

Dones:
- FUCK, application is read-only. My attempts to set it to read/write aren't taking.
   (FIXED, needed to revoke access)
- need to authenticate requests.  Seems like we pass authenticity_token by default
   (I think this is working magically)

- partials for follwing/etc (DONE)
