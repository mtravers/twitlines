Twitter API:
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-friends_timeline

Timeline API:
  http://simile-widgets.org/wiki/Timeline

Todo:

- ought to expand vertically for big screenss
  (done, but needs to be smarter)

- dynamic update on scroll
  sort of working (in branch) but completely breaks search
  - it ought to be driven by lower band I guess.
  - Re "nowing" doesn't update, I think theres a bug in the range related to current-time (whcih can change)


- (minor) embedded LFs in tweets break formatting?

- wild-ass idea: include feedback, scale blocks depending on how much we like this person/term.  Could make it practical to have busy streams.  

- idea: do same for Friendfeed!
  http://friendfeed.com/api/documentation#read_feed
  uses Oauth and Json, should be easy.

- idea: use this api to get identity of user (and key state to it)
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-statuses-user_timeline

- would be nice to visually indicate the last-clicked block, so when you go back to that window you can find it.

- this is getting linkified wrong:
  http://www.flickr.com/photos/38345565@N08/4251812514/ wonky rails

- This one gets <br> attached to url, so doesn't work
 http://twitter.com/orgnet/status/7387708381

- (minor) line break should be smarter, go backwards if necessary.

- (minor) Enter in search box

- would like to change layout so later things appear under rather than over.

- layout -- if there are too many things in one time slice, you lose.  That's kind of sucky.

- redo colors, roundrects. 

- maybe images should not come from twivatr

- twitter queries should have user-agent string  
  http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting

- auto-scroll

- I'm doing this all wrong:
   http://docs.heroku.com/background-jobs

- Flow: Login/search/etc 
   Login is unnecessary
   Logout: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-account%C2%A0end_session
   need to indicate mode (public, home, search, etc)

- local search 
  Here's how you do it...would need a gmap or something for specifying it.
  url = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?&rpp=100&geocode=37.638015%2C-122.494812%2C10km"

- styling (DONE, well, in progress)
- search (DONE to second cut)
   - problem is that really popular terms ("tsa", right now) stack up too much.   "Lisp" is OK.
   - paging for search is entirely different



- timezone

- what's with 127.0.0.1 - - [Mon, 28 Dec 2009 18:17:10 GMT] "GET /__history__.html?0 HTTP/1.1" 404 -1

Deployment:
- Lisp on EC2 (expensive and highly unncessary)
  http://tech.coop/Hosting%20Services SBCL hosting $10/month!  GOod for future ref

- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service. (Heroku)
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
  - and there's an OAuth plugin, of course

- or PHP even, and it can run on hyperphor

- or do everything in Javascript with no server involvement...
    Unfortunately this can't work (could with a simple PHP proxy, but lose the no-server advantages)

- Need to get local version of simile to guart against breakage.

Message to twivatar author (but I think the problem may be at twitter)
  http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=396

Thanks for building Twivatar and making it available as a public resource!  

However, I'm writing to report a bug, which is that some mini icons are not in fact very miniaturized.  For instance, this URL:

   http://twivatar.org/danbri/mini

Redirects to this one, which is fairly large:

   http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/502641047/danbri-4x-buttons-foaf_mini.jpg

It looks like the string "mini" in the original image name is confusing things somehow -- all the cases where this is happening look like that.

Anyway, thanks again, let me know if I can help.

Mike Travers
