Timeline API:


Todo:
- links
  - done in annoying popups, but:
  - need to have internal links as links
     - can put <a>'s in title, works OK, but then shows up escaped in Bubble!  Fuck!
  - need to set _target (DONE)
- icons
  - done, but formatting needs adjusting (see       /misc/sourceforge/simile-widgets-read-only/timeline/trunk/src/webapp/api/scripts/compact-painter.js
  - some appear huge!  God knows why.
- Webpage for user/password
- Use OAuth
- dynamic update on scroll
- styling

- I wonder if I could get tweets folded into two lines, would match icons and generally 


Deployment:
- EC2 (expensive)
- rewrite in Rails and use that groovy new hosting service.
  there's hardly any code so this is perfectly fine.
